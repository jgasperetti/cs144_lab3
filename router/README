Packet validation
    - length not too long/short
    - checksum valid
    - addressed to either our eth addr or the broadcast addr

Note on Endianness:
    - Unlike the last lab, I didn't transform the byte order of entire
        packets at once. Often I only needed to reach into theIP header for
        only a couple of fields, and such a broad-handed approach didn't
        seem appropriate. Instead, I use maintain the invariant that things
        in IP headers are always in network byte order.
